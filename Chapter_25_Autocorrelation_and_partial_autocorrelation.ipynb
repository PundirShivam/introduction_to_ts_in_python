    "## Auto regression Intution\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a time series that was generated by an autoregression (AR) process with a lag of k. We know that the ACF describes the autocorrelation between an observation and another observation at a prior time step that includes direct and indirect dependence information. This means we would expect the __ACF for the AR(k) time series to be strong to a lag of k and the inertia of that relationship would carry on to subsequent lag values__,trailing of at some point as the effect was weakened. We know that the PACF only describes the direct relationship between an observation and its lag. This would suggest that there would be no correlation for lag values beyond k. This is exactly the expectation of the ACF and PACF plots for an AR(k) process.\n",

    "## Moving Average Intution\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a time series that was generated by a moving average (MA) process with a lag of k. Remember that the moving average process is an autoregression model of the time series of residual errors from prior predictions. Another way to think about the moving average model is that it corrects future forecasts based on errors made on recent forecasts. We would expect the ACF for the MA(k) process to show a strong correlation with recent values up to the lag of k, then a sharp decline to low or no correlation. By definition, this is how the process was generated. For the PACF, we would expect the plot to show a strong relationship to the lag and a trailing of correlation from the lag onwards. Again, this is exactly the expectation of the ACF and PACF plots for an MA(k) process.\n",
